# Main Menu Feature Requirements

## Overview
Create a main UI menu that launches first when the application starts, providing easy access to all game modes and configuration options without requiring YAML file editing.

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1: Application Launch
**As a** user  
**I want** to see a main menu when I start the application  
**So that** I can easily choose how I want to interact with the game

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main menu window instead of launching directly into the game
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL show clear options for all available game modes
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL provide an easy way to exit the application

### User Story 2: Human Play Mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I select "Play Tetris" from the main menu THEN the system SHALL launch the game in human play mode
- WHEN human play mode is selected THEN the system SHALL disable AI control and training
- WHEN human play mode is selected THEN the system SHALL enable keyboard controls for piece movement

### User Story 3: AI Watch Mode
**As a** user interested in AI  
**I want** to watch a trained AI play Tetris  
**So that** I can observe how the genetic algorithm performs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I select "Watch AI Play" from the main menu THEN the system SHALL launch the game with AI control enabled
- WHEN AI watch mode is selected THEN the system SHALL disable training mode
- WHEN AI watch mode is selected THEN the system SHALL load the best available trained AI
- WHEN AI watch mode is selected THEN the system SHALL display AI performance statistics

### User Story 4: AI Training Mode
**As a** researcher or developer  
**I want** to train the genetic algorithm AI  
**So that** I can improve the AI's performance through evolution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I select "Train AI" from the main menu THEN the system SHALL launch the game in training mode
- WHEN AI training mode is selected THEN the system SHALL enable both AI control and training
- WHEN AI training mode is selected THEN the system SHALL display training progress and statistics
- WHEN AI training mode is selected THEN the system SHALL provide options to save/load generations

### User Story 5: Configuration Access
**As a** user  
**I want** to access game and AI configuration options  
**So that** I can customize the experience without editing YAML files

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I select "Settings" from the main menu THEN the system SHALL display a configuration dialog
- WHEN the settings dialog is displayed THEN it SHALL show current configuration values
- WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL save the changes to the configuration file
- WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on the changes

### User Story 6: Sound Control
**As a** user  
**I want** to easily enable or disable sound effects  
**So that** I can control the audio experience

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL show the current sound setting
- WHEN I toggle the sound setting THEN the system SHALL immediately update the configuration
- WHEN I toggle the sound setting THEN the system SHALL provide audio feedback if enabled

### User Story 7: Return to Menu
**As a** user  
**I want** to return to the main menu from any game mode  
**So that** I can easily switch between different modes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I press ESC during gameplay THEN the system SHALL pause the game and show a menu
- WHEN I select "Return to Main Menu" THEN the system SHALL close the current game and return to the main menu
- WHEN I return to the main menu THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved progress appropriately

### User Story 8: Application Exit
**As a** user  
**I want** to easily exit the application  
**So that** I can close the program when I'm done

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN I select "Exit" from the main menu THEN the system SHALL close the application cleanly
- WHEN I press the window close button THEN the system SHALL close the application cleanly
- WHEN the application is closing THEN the system SHALL save any unsaved progress or configurations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL load within 2 seconds of application startup
- WHEN switching between menu and game modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and responsive

### Usability Requirements
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL be intuitive and easy to navigate
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL provide clear visual feedback for user interactions
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL be accessible with both mouse and keyboard navigation

### Compatibility Requirements
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL work consistently across different operating systems
- WHEN the main menu is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain the existing Java Swing look and feel
