# Product Context: AI-GA-Tetris

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Traditional Tetris AI implementations often use hand-crafted heuristics that require extensive tuning and may not find optimal strategies. There's a need for a self-improving AI system that can discover effective playing strategies through evolutionary computation.

### Target Problems Solved
1. **AI Strategy Discovery**: Automatically find optimal Tetris playing strategies without manual heuristic design
2. **Educational Demonstration**: Provide a clear example of genetic algorithms in action for learning purposes
3. **Research Platform**: Enable experimentation with evolutionary computation parameters and techniques
4. **Entertainment**: Create an engaging way to watch AI learn and improve over time

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

#### For Researchers/Developers
1. **Setup**: Configure genetic algorithm parameters in `application.yml`
2. **Training**: Run AI training mode to observe evolution over generations
3. **Analysis**: Monitor fitness scores and performance metrics
4. **Experimentation**: Adjust parameters and observe impact on AI performance
5. **Persistence**: Save successful generations for later use or analysis

#### For Casual Users
1. **Watch Mode**: Observe trained AI playing optimally
2. **Human Play**: Play traditional Tetris against the game mechanics
3. **Sound Experience**: Optional audio feedback for enhanced gameplay

### Core User Journeys
